    "description": "The Xano Connector uses the official Xano SDK and makes connecting your Bubble app to a Xano backend super simple by persisting user login states across browser tabs and windows and calling data from Xano directly from the browser for super fast data retrieval.\n\nFor a walkthrough of setting up this plugin please visit my YouTube channel and watch the Getting Started with the Xano Connector episode.\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@EliBeachy\n\nFollowing are the features available to you in the Xano Connector\n\n—————————————— \t\n\nELEMENT - XANO AUTH\nThe Xano Auth element is the key that manages persisting your user sessions across page loads and new tabs. This element should be present on each individual page and exposes a bunch of actions, states, and events that are useful for managing your user. We’ve tried to mimic familiar Bubble terminology to make is simple understanding these states.\n\nAvailable Actions\n- Sign the Xano user up: Accepts first name, last name, email, and password inputs and will sign the user up via the default ‘/auth/signup’ endpoint in Xano.\n- Log the Xano user in: Accepts email and password inputs and will log the user in via the default ‘/auth/login’ endpoint provided by Xano.\n\nIf you are using SSO to verify your users in Xano you should use the ‘Set the Xano auth token’ action to log your users token instead.\n\nIt’s recommended to store the user values on Bubble’s ‘current user’ so that you can access these details from any element in your Bubble application.\n\nAvailable States \n- First name: User’s first name\n- Last name: User’s last name\n- Email: User’s account email\n- Is logged in: Indicates if the user is currently logged in\n- Auth token: Token to store on the user if you want to make authenticated API calls to the Xano API via the API connector\n- Error message: Information about the error that occurred\n- Error code: Code that can be used as conditions to run different workflows when an error occurs\n- Status code: Code returned from the most recent call to the Xano API\n\nWe have also provided useful events to make managing your users super simple. \n\nAvailable Events\n- User is logged in: This event will run anytime a user is manually logged in and on page load if the user’s current auth token is valid. Use this event to save user details to Bubble’s ‘current user’ object from the Xano Auth element.\n- User is logged out: This event will run anytime a user is manually logged out and on page load if the user’s current auth token is invalid or missing. Use this event to clear user details from Bubble’s ‘current user’ object.\n- Threw an error: The event will run anytime an error occurs in the Xano Auth element. Use this event in conjunction with the error states on the Xano Auth element to manage the user experience.\n\n—————————————— \t\n\nELEMENT - XANO QUERY\nThe Xano Query element retrieves lists of data from your Xano database using the API group and endpoint you specify. This element is incredibly powerful and allows you to return any data you want by creating those response types via the API Connector by setting up virtual data types. \n\nFor details on setting up virtual data types and using them with the Query element, visit my YouTube channel and watch the Getting Started with the Xano Connector episode.\n\nAvailable Fields:\n- Data type: Select the type of data being returned. If nothing is selected here we will only display the raw JSON response\n- Endpoint: Specify the endpoint this element should query\n- Group URL: This is the API group where the endpoint exists. If not populated we will use the default Group URL defined in the plugin settings\n- Body JSON: This is a free form field. Use this field to pass the JSON payload to populate any inputs your API is expecting. \n\nAvailable Actions\n- Refresh data: Retrieves the latest data\n\nAvailable Events\n- Threw an error: Runs when an error occurs getting the data\n\nWe expose a ton of states on this element to make managing pagination and data retrieval super simple. If you set up pagination in Xano the query element will automatically detect that and expose all the pagination meta data in the Xano Query element.\n\nAvailable States\n- Data: Returns data as the virtual data type you selected\n- Raw JSON Body: Text of the full JSON response received from the Xano API\n- Error message: Information about the error that occurred\n- Error code: Code that can be used as conditions to run different workflows when an error occurs\n- Status code: Code returned from the most recent call to the Xano API\n- Current page: Page number of the current page of data being viewed\n- Next page: Use to pass back to the API to get the next page of data\n- Previous page: Use to pass back to the API to get the previous page of data\n- Items received: Number of items received for the current page\n- Total items: Total number of items available in the database\n- Total pages: Total number of pages that can be retrieved.\n\n—————————————— \t\n\nELEMENT - XANO GET\nThe Xano Get element retrieves a single record from your Xano database by ID using the API group and endpoint you specify. This element is incredibly powerful and allows you to return any data you want by creating those response types via the API Connector by setting up virtual data types. \n\nFor details on setting up virtual data types and using them with the Query element, visit my YouTube channel and watch the Getting Started with the Xano Connector episode.\n\nAvailable Fields:\n- Data type: Select the type of data being returned. If nothing is selected here we will only display the raw JSON response\n- Endpoint: Specify the endpoint this element should query\n- Group URL: This is the API group where the endpoint exists. If not populated we will use the default Group URL defined in the plugin settings\n- Record ID: The ID of the record you would like to retrieve.\n\nAvailable Events\n- Threw an error: Runs when an error occurs getting the data\n\nAvailable States\n- Data: Returns data as the virtual data type you selected\n- Raw JSON Body: Text of the full JSON response received from the Xano API\n- Error message: Information about the error that occurred\n- Error code: Code that can be used as conditions to run different workflows when an error occurs\n- Status code: Code returned from the most recent call to the Xano API\n\n—————————————— \t\n\nACTION - LOG THE XANO USER OUT\nThis action will log the user out from the browser they are using and will trigger events on the Xano Auth element indicating the user has been logged out. Please make sure to update any data you may have saved to the current user as well when this action is run.\n\n—————————————— \t\n\nACTION - SET THE XANO AUTH TOKEN\nIf you are using an email/password authentication method it’s better to use the actions on the Xano Auth element to manage user signup and login. This action is designed to set the auth token manually if you are allowing your users to login via SSO such as Google or Facebook. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: You will need to create the login flow for each SSO in your Xano instance and then set the auth token from Xano here when you receive it.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Events such as ‘user is logged in’ will be triggered on the Xano Auth element when running this action.\n",
