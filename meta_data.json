Enable real-time in your Xano workspace settings.\n2. Obtain the connection hash provided after enabling real-time.\n3. Update the Xano plug-in in your Bubble app with the real-time hash.\n\n### Components in the Xano Plug-In\n\n- **Xano Real-Time Listener:** Listens for messages on specified channels.\n- **Actions:**\n  - Join real-time channel\n  - Leave real-time channel\n  - Send real-time message\n\n### Working with Channels\n\n- Users can join multiple channels to receive messages.\n- Messages sent to a channel are surfaced and triggered in the browser.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n1. Add a Xano real-time listener element to the page.\n2. Define channels and set up join/leave buttons.\n3. Send messages using the send real-time message action.\n4. Listen for messages on specific channels using the listener element.\n\n### Real-Time Interaction\n\n- Messages can be strings, JSON objects, or arrays.\n- Real-time updates allow for collaboration, chats, notifications, and more.\n\n### Testing Real-Time Functionality\n\n- Test real-time functionality within the same browser across different tabs or windows.\n- Ensure messages are received and sent across channels for seamless communication.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The Xano real-time functionality offers a simple yet powerful way to enable real-time communication in your Bubble app.\n- Stay tuned for more detailed tutorials and resources from Xano for maximizing the potential of real-time functionality.\n\nLink to Loom\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/35a6797a6edc49e281fef10c177937ec\n\n\n----------------------\n\nThis plugin is built and maintained by Eli Beachy and Jared Gibb.
